Search for your lab host using the `+Filter by name+` search box at the top of the inventory list. You can find your system’s name by running the `+hostname+` command in the `+terminal+` tab.

If you click on your system in the list, you will be brought to that host’s detail page.

You can see the amount of information that Insights is able to report to you about your system under the general tab.

Head over to the Advisor tab, and we’ll see if the Advisor service has any recommendations for our system.

You can see that our system has a few recommendations. The Remediation column tells us whether Insights can remediate these via a playbook, or if they need to be remediated manually. In this example, the first item in the list could be remediated via a playbook.
